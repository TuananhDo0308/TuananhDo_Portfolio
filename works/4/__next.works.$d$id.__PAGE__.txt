Existing solutions require manual input, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. The challenge was to develop an AI system that could analyze food images and automatically calculate nutritional content.","solution":"Developed a React Native mobile app with AI integration to analyze food images. Researched and implemented methods to estimate object mass from 2D images for accurate nutritional analysis. Created visualized charts to display nutritional data in an accessible format.","result":"Successfully published research in the Asian Journal of Research in Computer Science (DOI: 10.9734/ajrcos/2025/v18i5650). Won 2nd Prize at Faculty Level, Encouragement Prize at University Level, and 3rd Prize at Ministry Level Scientific Research Competition. Created a functional app that automates nutritional tracking.","images":["https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490645935967-10de6ba17061?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop","https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1498837167922-ddd27525d352?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop","https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1547592180-85f173990554?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop"],"tags":["React Native","AI/ML","Python","Redux","Computer Vision"],"githubUrl":"https://github.com/TuananhDo0308/nutrition-app-mobile"}}],[["$","script","script-0",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/f14ee46e2e14ec54.js","async":true}]],["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
